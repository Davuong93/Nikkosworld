  <h2>Why I want to Learn Code</h2>
  <h4><i>By David Vuong</i></h4>
  <p> I want to learn code because I would like to start a transition out of Ophthalmology. I begin to feel that I am
    not making a difference in this world nor am I happy with my current self. I hope by learning code I can better
    myself as a human being and be happier with myself with what I do. I primary use computers as a source for all my
    daily activities, socializing and hobbies.</p>
